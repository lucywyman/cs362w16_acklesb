For: CS 362 Final Project

Bug 1:
======

To reproduce:
-------------
``make clean && make myTest``

The Error:
----------
./unittest1 &> unittestresult.out
/bin/sh: 1: ./unittest1: not found
./unittest2 >> unittestresult.out
/bin/sh: 1: ./unittest2: not found
Makefile:69: recipe for target 'myTest' failed
make: *** [myTest] Error 127

There's no files ``unittest1`` or ``unittest2``.

Bug:
----
The issue here is that compiling his unittests isn't a dependency for this 
make definition, so the Makefile tries to execute executables that aren't 
there because they haven't been created.  There's a different target in 
the Makefile, ``unittestresult.out`` that does actually work as myTest is 
expected to, but you have to actually open the Makefile to find this. 

The Solution:
-------------

Just rename the Makefile targets to what's expected or document the changes
